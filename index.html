    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>
      I am doing web development for approximately 11 years.
      I've started at very young age.
      My very first web site was for promotion of my own Counter-Strike clan.
      Then I had an opportunity to create a very important registration system
      for marathon runners for Europe's oldest marathon event.
      That basically started my career as a web developer. I had some projects while I was studying on high school and university.
      After that I started to work full time as a web developer and gain more experience in developing real-time web applications.
